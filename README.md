## ‚ú® Key Features

* üñºÔ∏è **Dynamic Welcome & Leave Banners**: Automatically generates personalized images using `node-canvas` when a user joins or leaves, incorporating their avatar, username, and ID onto a custom background.
* üîó **Advanced Invite Tracking**: Accurately detects which invite a new member used to join, gives credit to the inviter, and updates their total invite count in the database.
* üîÑ **Role Persistence**: Remembers a user's roles when they leave the server. If they rejoin, the bot automatically restores their previous roles, saving administrators time.
* üìä **Live Server Stats**: Keeps a voice channel updated with the server's current member count, providing an easy-to-see statistic.
* ‚ö° **Modern Slash Command Handler**: Features a robust, file-based handler that automatically registers and loads all slash (`/`) commands from the `/commands` directory.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Highly Configurable**: Easily manage all server-specific IDs, channels, and roles from a central `config.js` file.
* üíæ **Database Integration**: Utilizes a database to persistently store user information, invite counts, and role backups.
