## ‚ú® Key Features

* üñºÔ∏è **Dynamic Welcome & Leave Banners**: Automatically generates personalized images using `node-canvas` when a user joins or leaves, incorporating their avatar, username, and ID onto a custom background.
* üîó **Advanced Invite Tracking**: Accurately detects which invite a new member used to join, gives credit to the inviter, and updates their total invite count in the database.
* üîÑ **Role Persistence**: Remembers a user's roles when they leave the server. If they rejoin, the bot automatically restores their previous roles, saving administrators time.
* üìä **Live Server Stats**: Keeps a voice channel updated with the server's current member count, providing an easy-to-see statistic.
* ‚ö° **Modern Slash Command Handler**: Features a robust, file-based handler that automatically registers and loads all slash (`/`) commands from the `/commands` directory.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Highly Configurable**: Easily manage all server-specific IDs, channels, and roles from a central `config.js` file.
* üíæ **Database Integration**: Utilizes a database to persistently store user information, invite counts, and role backups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the bot running on your own server.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v22.9.0 or higher is recommended)
* A Discord Bot Token

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/TarinWelcomer.git](https://github.com/Maniseniler/TarinWelcomer.git)
cd TarinWelcomer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure the Bot
Create a `config.js` file in the root directory and populate it with your server's information.
```js
// config.js
module.exports = {
    // --- Bot Credentials ---
    clientTOKEN: "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
    clientID: "YOUR_BOTS_CLIENT_ID",

    // --- Server & Channel IDs ---
    serverID: "YOUR_GUILD_ID",
    infoChannel: "VOICE_CHANNEL_ID_FOR_MEMBER_COUNT",
    welcomeChannel: "CHANNEL_ID_FOR_WELCOME_MESSAGES",
    leftChannel: "CHANNEL_ID_FOR_LEAVE_MESSAGES",

    // --- Role IDs ---
    memberRole: "DEFAULT_MEMBER_ROLE_ID",

    // --- Bot Info ---
    name: "TarinWelcomer",
    devs: ["YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID"],
};
```
### 4. Add Image Templates
Place your custom background images in the root directory:
- `welcome.png` (Template for new members)
- `left.png` (Template for departing members)

### 5. Set Up the Database
The bot is configured to work with a database via the `./models/database.js` file. Ensure your database connection and schema are properly set up to handle the functions used in the code (e.g., `saveUser`, `updateInvites`, `updateBackupRoles`).

### 6. Run the Bot
Start the bot using Node.js.
```bash
:loop
node index.js
goto loop
```
The bot should now be online and fully operational in your server!
üîß Customization
Images: You can change the design and layout of the welcome/leave banners by editing the templates (`welcome.png`, `left.png`) and adjusting the drawing coordinates in the `sendCanvasMessage` function.
